# Tyle - User Interface

This repository holds the source code for the UI application of the IGEN 430 project, Tyle. This application pairs with the physical tile grid over wifi and allows users to view its stream of pressure sensor data and program its LEDs.

There are three modes of operation:

1. Data -- Allows users to view a realtime stream of pressure sensor data coming from the tile grid.
2. Draw -- Allows users to "draw" using the grid's LEDs.
3. Program -- Provides simple logic statements that allow users to program the tile grid's LEDs based on the current pressure sensor value.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install` to install all the packages
3. `npm start` to run the app.
